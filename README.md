============

Utah has some cool startup companies living in it, and I wanted a visual way to see those companies in a maintainable and community-driven way. So, make a pull-request! Open an issue!

Look in the `companies` folder for examples. The frontmatter (stuff between the `---`) must specify a loc field in order to be displayed on the map. After that, valid markdown will be used to render what is in the popup box.
